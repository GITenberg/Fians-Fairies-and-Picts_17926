<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>The following treatise is to some extent a re-statement and partly an
amplification of a theory I have elsewhere advanced.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But as that
theory, although it has been advocated by several writers, especially
during the past half-century, is not familiar to everybody, some remarks
of an explanatory nature are necessary. And if this explanation assumes
a narrative form, not without a tinge of autobiography, it is because
this seems the most convenient way of stating the case.</p>

<p>It is now a dozen years or thereabouts since I first read the "Popular
Tales of the West Highlands," by Mr. J.F. Campbell, otherwise known by
his courtesy-title of "Campbell of Islay." Mr. Campbell was, as many
people know, a Highland gentleman of good family, who devoted much of
his time to collecting and studying the oral traditions of his own
district and of many lands. His equipment as a student of West Highland
folklore was unique. He had the necessary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span> knowledge of Gaelic, the
hereditary connection with the district which made him at home with the
poorest peasant, and the sympathetic nature which proved a master-key in
opening the storehouse of inherited belief. It is not likely that
another Campbell of Islay will arise, and, indeed, in these days of
decaying tradition, he would be born too late.</p>

<p>In reading his book, then, for the first time, what impressed me more
than anything else in his pages were statements such as the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The ancient Gauls wore helmets which represented beasts. The
enchanted king's sons, when they come home to their dwellings, put
off <i>cochal</i> [a Gaelic word signifying], the husk, and become men;
and when they go out they resume the <i>cochal</i>, and become animals
of various kinds. May this not mean that they put on their armour?
They marry a plurality of wives in many stories. In short, the
enchanted warriors are, as I verily believe, nothing but real men,
and their manners real manners, seen through a haze of
centuries.... I do not mean that the tales date from any particular
period, but that traces of all periods may be found in them&mdash;that
various actors have played the same parts time out of mind, and
that their manners and customs are all mixed together, and truly,
though confusedly, represented&mdash;that giants and fairies and
enchanted princes were men ... that tales are but garbled popular
history, of a long journey through forests and wilds, inhabited by
savages and wild beasts; of events that occurred on the way from
east to west, in the year of grace, once upon a time" (I.
cxv.-cxvi.). "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> Highland giants were not so big but that their
conquerors wore their clothes; they were not so strong that men
could not beat them, even by wrestling. They were not quite
savages; for though some lived in caves, others had houses and
cattle and hoards of spoil" (I. xcix.). "And though I do not myself
believe that fairies <i>are</i> ... I believe there once was a small
race of people in these islands, who are remembered as fairies, for
the fairy belief is not confined to the Highlanders of Scotland"
(I. c.) "This class of stories is so widely spread, so
matter-of-fact, hangs so well together, and is so implicitly
believed all over the United Kingdom, that I am persuaded of the
former existence of a race of men in these islands who were smaller
in stature than the Celts; who used stone arrows, lived in conical
mounds like the Lapps, knew some mechanical arts, pilfered goods
and stole children; and were perhaps contemporary with some species
of wild cattle and horses and great auks, which frequented marshy
ground, and are now remembered as water-bulls and water-horses, and
boobries, and such like impossible creatures" (IV. 344).</p></div>

<p>And much more to the same effect,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> with which it is unnecessary to
trouble the reader. Now, all this was quite new to me. If I had ever
given a second thought to the so-called "supernatural" beings of
tradition, it was only to dismiss them, in the conventional manner as
creatures of the imagination. But these ideas of Mr. Campbell's were
decidedly interest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>ing, and deserving of consideration. It was obvious
that tradition, especially where there had been an intermixture of
races, could not preserve one clear, unblemished record of the past; and
this he fully recognised. But it seemed equally obvious that the
"matter-of-fact" element to which he refers could not have owed its
origin to myth or fancy. The question being fascinating, there was
therefore no alternative but to make further inquiry. And the more it
was considered, the more did his theory proclaim its reasonableness. He
suggests, for example, that certain "fairy herds" in Sutherlandshire
were probably reindeer, that the "fairies" who milked those reindeer
were probably of the same race as Lapps, and that not unlikely they were
the people historically known as Picts. The fact that Picts once
occupied northern Scotland formed no obstacle to his theory. And when I
learned that the reindeer was hunted in that part of Scotland as
recently as the twelfth century, that remains of reindeer horns are
still to be found in the counties of Sutherland, Ross, and Caithness,
sometimes in the very structures ascribed to the Picts, then I perceived
this to be a theory which, to quote his words, "hung well together."
Further, the actual Lapps are a small-statured race, the fairies also
were so described, and this, too, I found to be the traditional idea
regarding the Picts. Here the identification was closer still.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> Then
came the consideration: The fairies lived in hollow hillocks and under
the ground: what kind of dwellings are the Picts supposed to have
occupied? The answer to this question still further strengthened Mr.
Campbell's conjecture. There yet exist numerous underground structures
and artificial mounds whose interior shows them to have been
dwelling-places; and these are in some places known as "fairy halls" and
in others as "Picts' houses." (Illustrations of these are shown in the
present volume, and are specially referred to in the annexed paper.)</p>

<p>The examination, therefore, of this interesting theory not only helped
greatly to bear out its probable correctness, but it further began to
appear that by following this method of inquiry new lights might be
thrown upon history&mdash;perhaps upon very remote history. It was clear that
the question was not a simple one. All tradition is obscured by the
darkness of time, and genuine fact is mixed up with ideas which belong
to the world of religion and of myth. Even in Mr. Campbell's own
statements there were seeming contradictions. These, however, it is not
my present purpose to discuss; since they do not vitally affect his main
contention.</p>

<p>The Lapp-Dwarf parallel was gone into very fully by Professor Nilsson in
his <i>Primitive Inhabitants of Scandinavia</i>, written twenty years before
the "West<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> Highland Tales." Not that he, either, was the originator of
that theory, for it is frequently referred to by Sir Walter Scott, who
accepted it himself.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> "In fact," he says, "there seems reason to
conclude that these <i>duergar</i> [in English, <i>dwarfs</i>] were originally
nothing else than the diminutive natives of the Lappish, Lettish and
Finnish nations, who, flying before the conquering weapons of the Asae,
sought the most retired regions of the north, and there endeavoured to
hide themselves from their eastern invaders." Scott, again, refers us
back to Einar Gudmund, an Icelandic writer of the second half of the
sixteenth century, whom I would cite as the earliest "Euhemerus" of
northern lands, were it not for the fact that he is obviously much more
than a theorist, and is beyond all doubt speaking of an actual race, as
may be seen from an incident which he relates.</p>

<p>But, although the popular memory may retain for many centuries the
impress of historical facts, these become inevitably blurred and
modified by the lapse of time and the ignorance of the very people who
preserve the tradition. As an illustration of this, I may cite the
instance of the dwarfs of Yesso, referred to in the following pages.
These people still survived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> as a separate community until the first
half of the seventeenth century, if not later. They occupied
semi-subterranean or "pit" dwellings, and are said to have been under
four feet in height. But, although the modern inhabitants of that island
still describe them, on the whole, in these terms, a new belief
regarding them has recently sprouted up in one corner. The A&iuml;no word
signifying "pit-dweller" is also not unlike the word for a burdock leaf.
It was known that those dwarfs were little people. Obviously, then,
their name must have meant "people living under burdock leaves" (instead
of "in pits"). And so, to some of the modern natives of Yesso, those
historical dwarfs of the seventeenth century "were so small that if
caught in a shower of rain or attacked by an enemy, they would stand
beneath a burdock leaf for shelter, or flee thither to hide."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In that instance, we see before our eyes the whole process by which a
real race has been transformed into an unreal impossibility, within a
period of two centuries or so. Had the extinction (or modification by
inter-marriage or by the processes of evolution) of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> Yesso dwarfs
taken place a thousand years earlier, the difficulty of identifying them
would have been greatly increased. After a race has once disappeared
from sight, the popular terms describing it must become more vague and
confused with every century. Thus, in a certain traditional Scotch story
there is mention of a number of "little black creatures with spades."
The description is delightfully comprehensive. It would be quite
applicable to a gang of Andaman coolies. On the other hand, if we
exclude the "spades," it might be applied to any "little black
creatures"&mdash;say a colony of tadpoles or of black-beetles. So that, when
a poet or an artist gets hold of a tradition which has reached this
stage of uncertainty, he may give the reins to his fancy, so long as he
portrays some kind&mdash;any kind&mdash;of "little black creatures."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Before parting altogether from the Yesso dwarfs, notice may be taken of
a folk-tale containing an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> incident which obviously derives its
existence from them, or from a branch of their race. In Mr. Andrew
Lang's "Green Fairy Book" there is introduced a certain Chinese "Story
of Hok Lee and the Dwarfs." It appears to be also current in Japan, to
judge from a reviewer's remark, that "the clever artist who has
illustrated the book must have known the Japanese story, for he gets
some of his ideas from the Japanese picture-maker." In the story of Hok
Lee the dwarfs are represented as living in subterranean dwellings, and
in the picture they are portrayed as half-naked, with (for the most
part) shaggy beards and eyebrows, and bald heads. It is wonderfully near
the truth. The baldness is one of the most striking characteristics of
those actual dwarfs, and is caused by a certain skin-disease, induced by
their dirty habits, from which a great number of them suffer, or did
suffer. The shaggy beards and eyebrows are equally characteristic of the
race; and their custom of occupying half-underground dwellings has given
them the name by which they are remembered in Japan at the present day.
The exact scene of the story is a matter of minor importance. Those
people appear to have been known to the Chinese for at least twelve
centuries, and to the Japanese for a much longer period. Thus, it was
quite unnecessary for any novelist in China or Japan to <i>invent</i> such
people, since they already existed. As for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> the details of that
particular story, or of any other of the kind, it is not to be supposed
that a belief in its historical basis necessarily implies an acceptance
of every statement contained in it. On this principle, one would be
bound to accept the truth of every "snake-story," for the simple reason
that one believed in the existence of snakes. Still, it is possible, and
perhaps not improbable, that tales which preserve the memory of those
people, may also be fairly accurate in many of the statements made
regarding them. The reason, however, of introducing this particular
story is to show that the Chinese or Japanese romancer did not require
to <i>create</i> a race of bald-headed, shaggy, half-wild dwarfs, seeing that
that had already been done for him by the Creator.</p>

<p>Those to whom this question is a new one will now see what is the point
of view of the realist or euhemerist with regard to such traditions. He
sees here and there in the past, through much intervening mist,
something that looks like a real object, and he tries to define its
outlines. He has no intention of denying, as some have vainly imagined,
that there <i>is</i> an intervening mist. Nor, it seems necessary to explain,
does he assume that wherever there is a mist there must be some tangible
object behind it. For example, he does not believe that Boreas, or
Zephyrus, or Jack Frost were ever anything but personifications of
certain natural forces.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span></p>

<p>Various other considerations have also to be borne in mind; not the
least important of which is the fact that the very people who have
preserved these traditional beliefs have done much to obscure them,
owing to their want of education. Scott tells a story of a Scotch
peasant who, discovering a company of gaily-dressed puppets standing in
a thicket, where they had been concealed by a travelling showman, at
once concluded that they were "fairies." He had inherited the belief
that fairies were "little people" who frequented just such places as
this; consequently, he decided these were fairies. This fact was
elicited in court, where the countryman had to appear as a witness. From
that time onward his mind ought to have been disabused of his hasty
belief. But a man so stupid as to assume that a showman's marionettes
were anything else than lifeless dolls, might continue for the rest of
his life to recount his marvellous meeting with "the fairies."
Similarly, to a tipsy man returning homeward from market, many common
and every-day objects take on a weird and superhuman aspect, due to no
other spirits than those he has consumed. From this cause, a large
number of odd stories (such as one told by Mr. William Black of a tipsy
Hebridean) has doubtless arisen. Further, the belief in the existence of
"supernatural" beings has been much utilised by rustic humourists, and
no doubt also by smugglers and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span> other night-birds, in comparatively
recent times. The prolonged absence of a husband, or it may be of a
wife, could be explained by some wild legend of having been "stolen by
the fairies," when a more frank avowal dared not be offered. And
although "strange tales were told" regarding the paternity of "Brian,"
in <i>The Lady of the Lake</i>, and although Scott adheres to those legends
in his poem, he does not fail to point out in his appended <i>Note</i> that
the story could be explained in a much more rational manner. There have
been many "Brians."</p>

<p>To give this subject the special attention which it deserves would,
however, swell these introductory notes to an intolerable size; and,
indeed, their purpose is rather to show what the euhemeristic theory is
than what it is not; that is to say, the euhemeristic theory as applied
to the traditions relating to dwarf races.</p>

<p>In the work to which I have referred, the opinions enunciated by
Professor Nilsson and Mr. J.F. Campbell, together with other
developments which suggested themselves to me, were duly set forth, and
were received, as was to be expected, with every form of comment, from
complete approval to entire dissent. Among the adverse criticisms, some
arose from a misapprehension of the case, while others were due to the
critic's imperfect acquaintance with the subject he professed to
discuss. But besides these, there were of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> course the legitimate
objections which can always be urged in matters of a debateable
character, where there is no positive evidence on either side. With
regard to such I can at least echo the words of one of the most eminent
and most courteous of my opponents, M. Charles Ploix, and say for
euhemerism what he says for naturalism:&mdash;"Tant que la th&eacute;orie sur
laquelle il s'appuie n'aura pas &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;montr&eacute;e fausse par des arguments
d&eacute;cisifs, et surtout tant qu'elle n'aura pas &eacute;t&eacute; remplac&eacute;e par une
hypoth&egrave;se plus certaine, il pourra continuer &agrave; s'affirmer."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>It ought to be mentioned that the following paper was written for the
Folk-Lore Society, at one of whose meetings (in February 1892) it was
subsequently read. As, however, the Council of that Society ultimately
decided that the paper was unsuited for publication in a journal devoted
to the study of folk-lore, it now appears in a separate form. One
advantage to be derived from this is that the illustrations which
accompanied the lecture, and which are of much importance in enabling
one to understand the argument, can also be reproduced at the same time.
It may be added that, while the theme is capable of much
amplification,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> have preferred to print the paper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> as it was written
for the occasion referred to. It states, concisely enough, the leading
points of the argument.</p>

<p>To those who are interested in the "realistic" interpretation of such
traditions, I beg to recommend for reference the following works:&mdash;First
and foremost, there is "The Anatomy of a Pygmie," by Dr. Edward Tyson
(London, 1699), a book full of suggestive notices. This author has
undoubtedly reached the "bed-rock" of the question; but, owing to his
era and mental environment, he has not realised that his argument is
useless without a consideration of the various stratifications above the
"bed-rock." Belonging to the same century is the chapter "Of Pigmies" in
Sir Thomas Browne's "Vulgar Errors," wherein he makes several very
interesting statements, although he argues from the opposite side.
Scattered throughout the writings of Sir Walter Scott, both poetry and
prose, there are also many references bearing upon this question, from
the realistic point of view. In addition to these, there is his
well-known treatise "On the Fairies of Popular Superstition," prefaced
to "The Tale of Tamlane," wherein he states that "the most distinct
account of the duergar [<i>i.e.</i> dwergs, or dwarfs], or elves, and their
attributes, is to be found in a preface of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span> Torf&aelig;us to the history of
Hrolf Kraka [Copenhagen, 1715], who cites a dissertation by Einar
Gudmund, a learned native of Iceland. 'I am firmly of opinion,' says the
Icelander, 'that these beings are creatures of God, consisting, like
human beings, of a body and rational soul; that they are of different
sexes, and capable of producing children, and subject to all human
affections, as sleeping and waking, laughing and crying, poverty and
wealth; and that they possess cattle and other effects, and are
obnoxious to death, like other mortals.' He proceeds to state that the
females of this race are capable of procreating with mankind;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and
gives an account of one who bore a child to an inhabitant of Iceland,
for whom she claimed the privilege of baptism; depositing the infant for
that purpose at the gate of the churchyard, together with a goblet of
gold as an offering."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Scott further cites from Jessen's <i>De
Lapponibus</i> similar matter-of-fact details obtained on this subject from
the Lapps; who, on their own showing, are inferentially the half-bred
descendants of dwarfs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span></p>

<p>"That some of the myths of giants and dwarfs are connected with
traditions of real indigenous or hostile tribes is settled beyond
question by the evidence brought forward by Grimm, Nilsson, and
Hanusch," observes Dr. E.B. Tylor.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> And although that eminent
anthropologist sees a different meaning in many kindred traditions, yet
his observations, and the great mass of references which he gives in
connection with this single detail, are of much interest to euhemerists
pure and simple. The late Sir Daniel Wilson's "Caliban"<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> teems with
the realistic doctrine, and so also does a work of (in my opinion) less
equal merit, "The Pedigree of the Devil,"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> by Mr. Frederic T. Hall.
In Mr. R.G. Haliburton's "Dwarfs of Mount Atlas: with notes as to Dwarfs
and Dwarf Worship,"<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and also in his "Further Notes"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> on that
subject, the same idea is prominent. All of these writers, with the
exception of Sir Thomas Browne (and excluding Dr. Tylor in so far as
regards some of his deductions), refer practically, though in varying
degrees, to the question discussed by Tyson; and in this respect I must
also cite my recent work on "The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span> A&iuml;nos" (pp. 51-66). Of other writers
who have not probed quite so deeply, and who possibly may not recognise
the necessity for so doing, but who are realists nevertheless, the
following may be mentioned: M. Paul Monceaux, who, in the <i>Revue
Historique</i> of October 1891, deals with the African dwarfs of ancient
and modern writers;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Professor Henri van Elven, the main theme of
whose forthcoming work, <i>Les Nains pr&eacute;historiques de l'Europe
Occidentale</i>, formed the subject of a paper recently read by him before
the <i>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'Arch&eacute;ologie de Bruxelles;</i> and MM. Grandgagnage and De
Reul, cited by Mr. C. Carter Blake, F.G.S., in connection with the
<i>Nutons</i> of the Belgian bone-caves;<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> as also another writer of the
Low Countries, Van den Bergh ("xxx. and 313"), whom Mr. J. Dirks quotes
at p. 15 of his <i>Heidens of Egypti&euml;rs</i>, Utrecht, 1850. In Mr. W.G.
Black's charming book on Heligoland,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> one passage (p. 72) recognises
that a certain Sylt tradition "is evidently one of those valuable
legends which illuminate dark pages of history. It clearly bears<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
testimony to the same small race having inhabited Friesland in times
which we trace in the caves of the Neolithic age, and of which the
Esquimaux are the only survivors." For many of the kindred traditions in
that locality, one cannot do better than refer to Mr. Christian Jensen's
<i>Zwergsagen aus Nordfriesland</i>, contributed to the <i>Zeitschrift des
Vereins f&uuml;r Volkskunde</i> (Berlin, Heft 4, 1892).</p>

<p>[The foregoing pages were all in type before the appearance of Vol.
VIII. of the <i>Biblioth&egrave;que de Carabas</i>, which contains several
criticisms by Mr. Andrew Lang on my "Testimony of Tradition" and
"Underground Life." The already excessive length of this Introduction
prevents me from now referring more particularly to these observations,
as I should otherwise have done. In the meantime, however, I beg to
refer Mr. Lang to the present work, and to ask him whether he thinks the
statements there quoted substantiate his conception of the <i>Fir Sidhe</i>
as a deathless people, occupying some region "unknown of earth."</p>

<p>An addition to the Bibliography of this subject is made in the
above-named volume (p. 88). "In his <i>Scottish Scenery</i> (1803), Dr.
Cririe suggests that the germ of the Fairy myth is the existence of
dispossessed aboriginals dwelling in subterranean houses, in some places
called Picts' houses, covered with artificial mounds. The lights seen
near the mounds are lights actually carried by the mound-dwellers." Mr.
Lang adds: "Dr. Cririe works out in some detail 'this marvellously
absurd supposition,' as the <i>Quarterly Review</i> calls it (vol. lix. p.
280)."]</p>

<h2>FIANS, FAIRIES AND PICTS.</h2>


<p>The general belief at the present day is that, of the three designations
here classed together, only that of the Picts is really historical. The
Fians are regarded as merely legendary&mdash;perhaps altogether mythical
beings; and the Fairies as absolutely unreal. On the other hand, there
are those who believe that the three terms all relate to historical
people, closely akin to each other, if not actually one people under
three names.</p>

<p>To those unacquainted with the views of the realists, or euhemerists, it
is necessary to explain that the popular definition of Fairies as
"little people" is one which that school is quite ready to accept. But
the conception of such "little people" as tiny beings of a&euml;rial and
ethereal nature, able to fly on a bat's back, or to sip honey from the
flowers "where the bee sucks,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> is regarded by the realists as simply
the outcome of the imagination, working upon a basis of fact. An
illustration of this position may be seen in the Far East. There is a
tradition among the A&iuml;nos of Northern Japan that they were preceded by a
race of "little people," only a few inches in height, whose
pit-dwellings they still point out. But the pottery and the skeletons
associated with these habitations show that not only were their
occupants of a stature to be measured by feet rather than by inches, but
also that, by reason of a certain anatomical peculiarity common to both,
the traditional dwarfs were very clearly the ancestors of the A&iuml;nos&mdash;a
race which, though now blended, was once most distinctly a race of
dwarfs, if one is to believe the earliest Japanese pictures of them.
Similarly, the dwarfs of European tradition are believed to have had as
real an origin as the little people of A&iuml;no legend, at any rate by those
who hold the realistic theory.</p>

<p>Any attempt to reconcile the pygmies of the classic writers with actual
dwarfs of flesh and blood is outside my province. Moreover, this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> has
been admirably, and, as it seems to me, successfully done quite recently
by M. Paul Monceaux, in an article in the <i>Revue Historique,</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
wherein he compares the traditional and historical descriptions with the
statements of modern travellers, and draws the inference that the
pygmies of the Greek and Roman writers, sculptors and painters, are all
derived from actual dwarfs seen by their forefathers in Africa and
India. (Still less doubt is there with regard to the dwarfs in Ancient
Egyptian paintings.) And whereas Strabo is, says M. Monceaux, the only
writer of antiquity who questions the existence of the dwarfs, all the
others are on the side of Aristotle, who says&mdash;"This is no fable; there
really exists in that region (the sources of the Nile), as people
relate, a race of little men, who have small horses and who live in
holes." And these little men were of course the ancestors of
Schweinfurth's and Stanley's dwarfs.</p>

<p>But although M. Monceaux confines his identification to equatorial
Africa and to India, he does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> not omit to state that Pliny and other
writers speak of dwarf tribes in other localities, and among these are
"the vague regions of the north, designated by the name of Thule." This
area, vague enough certainly, is the territory with which Fians and
Picts are both associated; as, also, of course, the Fairies of North
European tradition.</p>

<p>The attributes with which the "little people" of North Europe are
accredited cannot be given in detail here. It is enough to note that
they were believed to live in houses wholly or partly underground, the
latter kind being described as "hollow" mounds, or hills; that when
people of taller race entered such subterranean dwellings (as
occasionally they did) they found the domestic utensils of the dwarfs
were of the kind labelled "pre-historic" in our antiquarian museums;
that the copper vessels which dwarf women sometimes left behind them
when discovered surreptitiously milking the cows of their neighbours,
were likewise of an antique form; further, that they helped themselves
to the beef and mutton of their neighbours, after having shot the
animals with flint-headed arrows; that melodies peculiar to them are
still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> sung by the peasants of certain localities; that words used by
them are still employed by children in their games; and that many
families in many districts are believed to have inherited some of their
blood.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Of this intercourse between the taller races and the dwarfs,
there are many records in old traditions. In the days of King Arthur,
when, as Chaucer tells us, the land was "ful-filled of fa&euml;rie," the
knights errant had usually a dwarf as attendant. One of King Arthur's
own knights was a Fairy.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> According to Highland tradition, every
high-caste family of pure Gaelic descent had an attendant dwarf. These
examples show the "little people" in a not unfriendly light. But many
other stories speak of them as "malignant" foes, and as dreaded
oppressors. Of which the rational explanation is that these various
tales relate to various localities and epochs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>The connection visible between Fians and Fairies, between Fians and
Picts, and between Picts and Fairies, may now briefly be stated.</p>

<p>The earliest known association of the first two classes occurs in an
Irish manuscript of the eleventh or twelfth century,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> wherein it is
stated that when the ninth-century Danes overran and plundered Ireland,
there was nothing "in concealment under ground in Erinn, or in the
various secret places belonging to Fians or to Fairies" that they did
not discover and appropriate. This statement receives strong
confirmation from a Scandinavian record, the <i>Landn&aacute;ma-bok</i>, which
says<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> that, in or about the year 870, a well-known Norse chief named
Leif</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"went on warfare in the west. He made war in Ireland, and there
found a large underground house; he went down into it, and it was
dark until light shone from a sword in the hand of a man. Leif
killed the man, and took the sword and much property.... He made
war widely in Ireland, and got much property. He took ten thralls."</p></div>

<p>Although the Scandinavian record does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> speak of the owner of the
earth-house as either a "Fian" or a "Fairy," it is quite evident that
this is an example of the plundering referred to in the Irish chronicle,
and that the Gaels of Ireland seven or eight centuries ago, if not a
thousand years ago, regarded the underground people as indifferently
Fians and Fairies.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>Many other associations of Fians with Fairies are to be seen. In one of
the old traditional ballads regarding the Fians, they are described as
feasting with Fairies in one of their "hollow" mounds.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> A
Sutherlandshire story relates the adventures of the son of a Fairy
woman, who took service with Ossian, the king of the Fians.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> One of
the Fians (Caoilte) had a Fairy sweet-heart.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Another of them (Oscar)
has an interview with a washerwoman who is a Fairy.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> A Fenian story
recounts how one day the Fians were working in the harvest-field, in the
Argyleshire island of Tiree, and on that occasion they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> had "left their
weapons of war in the armoury of the Fairy Hill of Caolas";<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> from
which one is to infer that the Fians made use of Fairy dwellings. In the
same collection of tales we are told<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> that one time when the Fians
were hunting in the Isle of Skye, they left their wives in a dwelling
which bore a title "applied to dwellings of the Elfin race." It is
further stated that one popular belief in the Scottish Highlands is that
the Fians are still lying in the hill of Tomnahurich, near Inverness,
and that "others say they are lying in Glenorchy, Argyleshire."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Now,
both the Inverness-shire mound and the mounds in Glenorchy are also
popularly regarded as the abodes of Fairies.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The vitrified fort on
Knock-Farril, in Ross-shire, is said to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> have been one of Fin McCoul's
castles;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and Knock-Farril, or rather "a knoll opposite Knock-Farril"
is remembered as the abode of the Fairies of that district.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Glenshee, in Perthshire, is celebrated equally as a Fairy haunt and as a
favourite hunting-ground of the Fians. The Fians, indeed, were said to
have lived by deer-hunting, so much so that Campbell of Islay suggests
that their name signifies "the deer men"; and the deer, it is believed,
"were a fairy race."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The famous hound of the famous leader of the
Fians was "a Fairy or Elfin dog." In short, the connection between Fians
and Fairies, recognised in the Gaelic manuscript of eight or ten
centuries ago, is apparent throughout the traditions of the
Gaelic-speaking people.</p>

<p>But if the Fians were either identical with, or closely akin to the
Fairies, they must have been "little people." The belief that they were
so is supported by one traditional Fenian story.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> This is the well-known
tale of the visit of Fin, the famous chief of the Fians, to a country
known to him and his people as "The Land of the Big Men." The story
tells how Fin sailed from Dublin Bay in his skin-boat, crossed the sea
to that country, and shortly after landing was captured and taken to the
palace of the king, where he was appointed court dwarf,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and remained
for a considerable time the attached and faithful adherent of the king.
The collector of this story has assumed that it is purely imaginary. But
let it be contrasted with the following extract from the <i>Heimskringla</i>.
The period is the early part of the eleventh century, and the scene
Norway: "There was a man from the Uplands called Fin the Little, and
some said of him that he was of Finnish race. He was a remarkable [?
remarkably] little man, but so swift of foot that no horse could
overtake him.... He had long been in the service of King Hrorek, and
often employed in errands of trust.... Now when King Hrorek was set
under guards on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> journey Fin would often slip in among the men of
the guard, and followed, in general, with the lads and serving-men; but
as often as he could he waited upon Hrorek, and entered into
conversation with him."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> And, like Fin the dwarf in the Gaelic story,
this little Fin rendered great service to his king. Now, the
<i>Heimskringla</i> Fin is unquestionably a historical personage, and the
account of him was written by a twelfth century historian. The Gaelic
story was only obtained in the Hebrides, and reduced to writing
twenty-three years ago. Although Fin of the Fians is stated in Irish
records to be the grandson of a Finland woman,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and although the
Scandinavian and the Hebridean tales look very much like two versions of
one story, this cannot precisely be the case, as the Fenian Fin is
placed in an earlier era than his namesake of Norway. A dwarf king named
Fin is also remembered in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> Frisian tradition;<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and that he and his
race were small men is pretty clearly proved by the fact that when one
of the earth-houses attributed to him was opened some years ago, it was
found to contain the bones of a little man.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Both of these dwarf
Fins, Little Fin of Norway and Little Fin of Denmark, are undoubtedly
real; and there seems no good reason to suppose that the dwarf Fin of
Hebridean tradition was not equally real. Whether they were three
separate people is a problem. "Fin" appears to have been at one time a
not uncommon name, whatever its etymology and that of "Fian" may be. At
any rate, there is nothing in history (which speaks of a close
intercourse between Scandinavia and the British Isles, in former times),
and nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> in the ethnology of North-Western Europe, to make us regard
as mythical the capture and enthralment of any one of these three
"little Fins." If Fin of the Fians, therefore, was a typical Fian, they
were little people.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>In regarding the Fians as a race of dwarfs, I do not overlook the fact
that they are also spoken of as "giants." But to assume them to have
been of gigantic stature is both totally at variance with the bulk of
the evidence regarding them, and at variance with the fact that the word
"giant" has very frequently been used to denote a savage, or a
cave-dweller.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> No more appropriate illustration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> of this can be found
than the local tradition that a certain artificially hollowed rock in
the island of Hoy, Orkney, was the abode of "a giant and his wife." Now,
this same "giant" is also remembered as a "dwarf," and the largest cell
in his dwelling is only 5 feet 8 inches long. Similarly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> there is in
Iceland a certain <i>Tr&ouml;llakyrkia</i> (literally "the dwarfs' church") which
is translated "the <i>giants'</i> church."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> For these reasons, then, I do
not regard any reference to the Fians as "giants" as indicating that
they were of tall stature; although I see no objection to the assumption
that they were savages and cave-dwellers.</p>

<p>Fians, then, are closely connected with the "little people" called
"Fairies." The connection between Fians and Picts is equally well
marked.</p>

<p>Regarding them historically, Dr. Skene identi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>fies the Fians with one or
other of two historical races believed to have occupied Ireland before
the coming of the Gaels. These two races are known in Irish story as the
Tuatha De and the Cruithn&eacute;.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Now, the Tuatha De <i>are</i> the Fairies of
Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Therefore, according to Dr. Skene, the Fians were either
Fairies or Cruithn&eacute;. Now, Cruithn&eacute; is simply a Gaelic name for the
Picts. Consequently, the Fians were either Fairies or Picts&mdash;according
to Dr. Skene. In one traditional story, already referred to, the Fians
seem to be unhesitatingly regarded as Picts. This story, obtained in
Sutherlandshire, tells how a certain king lived for a year with a
<i>banshee</i>, or fairy woman,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> by whom he had a son. When this son grew
up he went to the country of the Fians,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and there he entered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> into
the service of their king, who was no other than the celebrated Oisin.
The Gaelic narrator calls him "Oisin, Righ na Feinne," that is, "Ossian,
King of the Fians"; but the collector of the story,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> who had no doubt
obtained the translation on the spot, renders <i>Righ na Feinne</i> as "King
of the Picts." No explanation or comment is given, and one is therefore
led to infer that in Sutherlandshire <i>Feinne</i> is without question
regarded as a Gaelic name for the Picts. This identity is, indeed, borne
out otherwise. There is a Gaelic saying in Glenlyon, Perthshire, to the
effect that "Fin had twelve castles" in that glen, and the remains of
these "castles," all said to have been built by him and his Fians, and
of which one in particular is styled "Castle Fin,"<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> are known to the
English-speaking people of Scotland as "Picts'" houses. For they belong
to a peculiar class of structures, all radically alike, and all known,
in certain districts, as "Picts' houses." The term "Picts' house" is
unknown in the Hebrides, says<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> one writer. "In the Hebrides tradition is
entirely silent concerning the Picts ... there the Fenian heroes are the
builders of the duns."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Yet the self-same class of building is
elsewhere assigned to the Picts. To these structures I shall presently
refer more particularly; but it is enough to note in passing that, just
as Oisin, King of the Fians, is translated into Ossian, King of the
Picts, so the dwellings ascribed to the Fians in one locality, are in
another said to have been made and inhabited by the Picts.</p>

<p>Fians, then, are associated or identified with Fairies, and also with
Picts. To complete my equilateral triangle, the Picts ought also to be
regarded as Fairies, or as akin to them.</p>

<p>This undoubtedly is a popular belief. The earliest alleged reference of
this kind is placed by one writer in the middle of the fifteenth
century, before the Orkney Islands had passed from the crown of Denmark
to the crown of Scotland. A manuscript of the then Bishop of Orkney,
dated Kirkwall 1443, states that when Harald Haarfagr conquered the
Orkneys in the ninth century, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> inhabitants were the two "nations" of
the <i>Pap&aelig;</i> and the <i>Peti</i>, both of whom were exterminated. By the former
name is understood the Irish missionaries: the <i>Peti</i> were certainly the
Picts, or Pehts.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Now, of these Picts of Orkney it is said, that they
"were only a little exceeding pigmies in stature, and worked wonderfully
in the construction of their cities, evening and morning, but in
mid-day, being quite destitute of strength, they hid themselves through
fear in little houses under ground."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>The exact date of this statement is at present doubtful, but it is quite
in accordance with the widespread ideas held throughout Scotland and
Northumberland with regard to the Picts: that they were great as
builders, but were of very low stature, and closely akin to Fairies.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
Moreover, they are famous for doing their work during the night.
Whatever be the explanation of the above curious statement that at
mid-day they lost their strength and withdrew to their underground
houses, it is at any rate interesting to compare with it the remark made
by the traveller Pennant as he was passing along Glenorchy in 1772. This
is the entry in his journal:&mdash;"See frequently on the road-sides small
verdant hillocks, styled by the common people shi an (<i>sithean</i>), or the
Fairy-haunt, because here, say they, the fairies, who love not the glare
of day, make their retreat after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> the celebration of their nocturnal
revels."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Now, as the "Picts' houses" are, to outward appearance,
"small verdant hillocks," the parallel is very exact. With these two
references compare also the mention, in a quaint old gazetteer printed
at Cambridge in 1693,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> of the tribe of the "Germara," defined as "a
people of the Celt&aelig;, who in the day-time cannot see." Although the
author usually gives the sources of his information, in this instance he
gives none. But the statement agrees perfectly with the belief found
everywhere throughout Northern Europe that "the dwarfs could not bear
daylight, and during the day hid in their holes."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> It really seems
impossible to avoid the inference that all this was perfectly true. When
Leif went down into the underground house in Ireland, he could not see
at first, though at length he saw in the obscurity the glimmer of his
opponent's sword. Consequently, the denizens and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> builders of these
subterranean retreats must either have had something very like "cat's
eyes," or else they must in general have had numerous lamps burning.
This will be understood by an examination of one or two of the
accompanying diagrams. It seems to me beyond question that a people
living this underground life must have differed very distinctly from
ourselves in the matter of vision; and to them the brightness of noonday
must have been blinding. This physical fact&mdash;if it be a fact&mdash;would
explain much that is otherwise strange and incredible in the traditions
relating to the Picts&mdash;or Pechts, as they were formerly called in
Scotland. However, it is sufficient for my present purpose to note that
this peculiarity associates, and indeed identifies, the Picts with the
dwarfs or fairies of tradition.</p>

<p>Having thus shown that Fians, Fairies, and Picts are so closely
associated as to be, in some aspects, almost indistinguishable from one
another, I shall now refer to the structures which are popularly
believed to have been their dwellings. Some of these are wholly
underground, others partly so, and others quite above ground. In many
other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> ways, also, they vary. But all of them are unquestionably links
in one special style of structure; of which the most marked feature, or
at any rate that which is common to all, is the use of what is called
the "cyclopean" arch. This is formed by the overlapping of the stones in
the wall until they almost meet at the dome or apex of the building,
when a heavy "keystone" completes this rude arch. The principle of the
arch proper was obviously quite unknown to the originators of such
structures.</p>

<p>Of the various Hebridean specimens of these buildings, very interesting
and complete descriptions have been given by the late Captain Thomas,
R.N.,<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and Sir Arthur Mitchell,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> who visited some of them together
in 1866. Referring to the most modern examples of this kind of
structure, the latter writer says:&mdash;"They are commonly spoken of as
beehive houses, but their Gaelic name is <i>bo'h</i> or <i>bothan</i>. They are
now only used as temporary residences or shealings by those who herd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the cattle at their summer pasturage; but at a time not very remote they
are believed to have been the permanent dwellings of the people." And he
thus describes his first sight of the beehive houses:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I do not think I ever came upon a scene which more surprised me,
and I scarcely know where or how to begin my description of it.</p>

<p>"By the side of a burn which flowed through a little grassy glen
... we saw two small round hive-like hillocks, not much higher than
a man, joined together, and covered with grass and weeds. Out of
the top of one of them a column of smoke slowly rose, and at its
base there was a hole about three feet high and two feet wide,
which seemed to lead into the interior of the hillock&mdash;its
hollowness, and the possibility of its having a human creature
within it being thus suggested. There was no one, however, actually
within the <i>bo'h</i>, the three girls, when we came in sight, being
seated on a knoll by the burn-side, but it was really in the inside
of these two green hillocks that they slept, and cooked their food,
and carried on their work, and&mdash;dwelt, in short."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p></div>

<p>These two "green hillocks," and other structures of the same nature, are
shown in the accompanying diagrams<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> (Plates I.-XVI.), which explain
their formation better than any written<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> description. It is enough here
to state that they are built of rough stone, without any mortar. "Though
the stone walls are very thick," says my authority (p. 62), "they are
covered on the outside with turf, which soon becomes grassy like the
land round about, and thus secures perfect wind and water tightness."
Sometimes they occur in groups, as those shown in Plate III.; of which
scene Captain Thomas justly remarks that "at first sight it may be taken
for a picture of a Hottentot village rather than a hamlet in the British
Isles."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Here there is little or no grassy covering outside, however;
and consequently none of the hillock-like effect. But this is very well
shown in Plates VI. and VIII. Of the "agglomeration of beehives"
pictured in the latter, Sir Arthur Mitchell observes:&mdash;"It has several
entrances, and would accommodate many families, who might be spoken of
as living in one mound, rather than under one roof" (<i>op. cit.</i> pp.
64-5). Of another such dwelling, now ruined, he says that it could have
accommodated "from forty to fifty people."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>This last, however (Plates XI. and XII.), represents another variety of
earth-house, the chambered mound or beehive, with an underground gallery
leading to it. Of this kind two examples are here shown. And in Plates
I. and XIII. will be seen specimens of wholly subterranean structures.
It is difficult, and indeed hardly necessary, to distinguish between one
variety and another of what is practically the same kind of building;
but to this last class the term "earth-house" is most frequently
accorded in Scotland. In the broader dialect it is "yird-house" or
"eirde-house," which at once recalls the form "jord-hus" in the saga
which tells of Leif's adventure underground in Ireland. The term <i>weem</i>
is also applied to these places in Scotland. This is merely a quickened
pronunciation of the Gaelic <i>uam</i> (or <i>uamh</i>), a cave; and it reminds
one that, both in Gaelic and in English, the word "cave" is by no means
restricted to a <i>natural</i> cavity. Indeed, one of the two artificial
structures under consideration is known as <i>Uamh Sgalabhad</i>, "the <i>cave</i>
of Sgalabhad." Another old Gaelic name for those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> underground galleries
is "<i>tung</i> or <i>tunga</i>";<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> while another name, by which they are known
in Lewis is <i>tigh fo thalaimh</i>,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> or "house beneath the ground."</p>

<p>"Martin, in his description of the Western Islands, printed in 1703,
when their use would appear to have been still remembered, speaks of
them [these underground structures] as 'little stone-houses, built under
ground, called earth-houses, which served to hide a few people and their
goods in time of war.'"<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Dean Monro writes, "There is sundry coves
and holes in the earth, coverit with hedder above, quhilk fosters many
rebellis in the country of the North head of Ywst" [North Uist].<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
"From O'Flaherty's description of West Connaught, written in 1684, it
appears," observes Captain Thomas,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> referring more strictly to
the beehive-house, "that this style of dwelling had already become
archaic." For, although that writer mentions certain "cloghans" as being
still inhabited, holding forty men in some cases, yet he says they were
"so ancient that nobody knows how long ago any of them were made." Of
the underground galleries another writer says: "It has been doubted if
these houses were ever really used as places of abode.... But as to this
there can be no real doubt. The substances found in many of them have
been the accumulated <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of food used by man.... Ornaments of
bronze have been found in a few of them, and beads of streaked glass. In
some cases the articles found would indicate that the occupation of
these houses had come down to comparatively recent times."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>In conclusion, these remarks of Captain Thomas, who made so thorough a
study of the subject, may be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Pict's house on the Holm of Papay [Orkney] would have held,
besides the chiefs at each end, all the families in [the island of]
Papay Westray when it was built. Maes howe<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> was for three
families&mdash;grandees, no doubt; but the numbers it was intended to
hold in the <i>beds</i> may be learned by comparing them with the
Amazon's House, St. Kilda."<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>"I consider the relation between the <i>boths</i> [beehive houses] and
the Picts' houses of the Orkneys (and elsewhere) to be evident&mdash;the
same method of forming the arch, the low and narrow doors and
passages, the enormous thickness of the walls, when compared with
the interior accommodation&mdash;exist in both. When a <i>both</i> is covered
with green turf it becomes a chambered tumulus, and when buried by
drifting sand it is a subterranean Pict's house.... I regard the
comparatively large Picts' houses of the Orkneys as the pastoral
residence of the Pictish lord, fitted to contain his numerous
family and dependents. Such an one exists on the Holm of Papa
Westray, which, according to the Highland method of stowage, would
certainly contain a whole clan. When writing the description of it,
I had not made acquaintance with a people who would close the door
to keep in the smoke, or that nested in holes in a wall like
sand-martins....</p>

<p>"But the <i>both</i> of the Long Island is only the lodging of the
common man or 'Tuathanach,' and is consequently of small
dimensions, and not remarkable for comfort. If the modern Highland
proprietor or large farmer should ever be induced to lead a
pastoral life, and adopt a Pictish architecture in his residence,
we might again see a tumulus of twenty feet in height, with its
long low passage leading into a large hall with beehive cells on
both sides."<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p></div>

<p>But the point of all this is that these dwellings, whether above ground
or below, are known as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> <i>Picts' Houses, Fairy Halls, Elf Hillocks</i>, "the
hidden places of <i>Fians and Fairies</i>." Thus, the three titles which I
have shown to be associated in other ways are all given to the alleged
builders and occupiers of those very archaic and peculiar structures.</p>

<p>It is true that, in their most modern form, some of those dwellings are
still inhabited for months at a time. And their inhabitants are neither
Fians, Fairies nor Picts. But it is among those people that stories of
Fians and Fairies are most rife, and many claim an actual descent from
them. And although they are certainly not pigmies, yet they live in a
district in which the <i>small</i> type of this heterogeneous nation of ours
is still quite discernible; and that part of the island of Lewis (Uig),
which has longest retained those places as dwellings, is inhabited by a
caste whom other Hebrideans describe as small, and regard as different
from themselves.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Dr. Beddoe states that the tallest people in the
United Kingdom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> are to be found in a certain village in Galloway, where
a six-foot man is perfectly common, and many are above that height. It
is quite certain that such men could not "nest like sand-martins" in the
holes in the wall described by Captain Thomas. And, in proportion as
such Galloway men are to the modern Hebridean mound-dwellers, so are
these to the much more archaic race with whom the oldest structures are
associated. For a study of the dimensions of these will show that they
could not have been conceived, and would not have been built or
inhabited by any but a race of actual dwarfs; as tradition says they
were.</p>

[<span class="smcap">Subsequent Note.</span>&mdash;A suitable companion to the dwarf Fin of
Frisian tradition is mentioned in Harald Hardradi's Saga:&mdash;"Tuta, a
Frisian, was with King Harald; he was sent to him for show, for he was
short and stout, in every respect shaped like a dwarf."&mdash;Quoted by Mr.
Du Chaillu at p. 357 of vol. ii. of "The Viking Age."]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40_40" id="Footnote_40_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> In this connection it is worth noting that Sir Walter
Scott, in referring to the aboriginal or servile clans in 1745, whom he
describes as "half naked, <i>stinted in growth</i>, and miserable in aspect,"
includes among them the McCouls, Fin's alleged descendants, who "were a
sort of Gibeonites, or hereditary servants to the Stewarts of Appin."
(Waverley, ch. xliv.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_41" id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> For example, the late Rev. J.G. Campbell, Tiree, says of
"the Great Tuairisgeul" that he was "a giant of the kind called
<i>Samhanaich</i>&mdash;that is, one who lived in a cave by the sea-shore, the
strongest and coarsest of any" (<i>Scottish Celtic Review</i>, p. 62). That
this term was one of contempt, given by Gaelic-speaking people to those
"giants" (and apparently based upon their malodorous characteristics),
will be seen from Mr. Campbell's further observation (<i>op. cit.</i> pp.
140-141):&mdash;"It is a common expression to say of any strong offensive
smell, <i>mharbhadh e na Samhanaich</i>, it would kill the giants who dwell
in caves by the sea. <i>Samk</i> is a strong oppressive smell." McAlpine
defines <i>Samk</i> as a "bad smell arising from a sick person, or a dirty
hot place"; and he further gives the definition "a savage" (quoting
Mackenzie). The word <i>Samhanach</i> itself is defined by McAlpine as "a
savage," and he cites the Islay saying:&mdash;"<i>chuireadh tu cagal air na
samhanaich</i>," "you would frighten the very savages." From these
definitions it will be seen that a word translated "giant" by one is
rendered "savage" by another (though neither of these terms expresses
the literal meaning). Mr. J.G. Campbell also practically regards it as
signifying "cave-dweller," or perhaps a certain special caste of
cave-dwellers. With this may be compared McAlpine's "<i>uamh</i>, <i>n.f.</i>, a
cave, den; <i>n.m.</i>, a chief of savages, terrible fellow ... '<i>cha'n'eil
ann ach uamh dhuine</i>,' 'he is only a savage of a fellow.'" Islay has
also another word to denote a Hebridean savage. This is <i>ciuthach</i>, "pr.
<i>kewach</i>, described in the Long Island as naked wild men living in
caves" (J.F. Campbell, Tales, iii. 55, <i>n.</i>). One of these "kewachs"
figures in the story of Diarmaid and Grainne, and one version says that
he "came in from the western ocean in a coracle with two oars
(<i>curachan</i>)" (<i>The Fians</i>, p. 54). (His name assumes various
shapes&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Ciofach Mac a Ghoill, Ciuthach Mac an Doill, Ceudach Mac
Righ nan Collach.) These three terms&mdash;<i>samhanach, uamh dhuine</i>, and
<i>ciuthach</i>&mdash;all seem to indicate one and the same race of people. And
these are probably the people referred to by Pennant when he says,
speaking of the civilised races of the Hebrides in the beginning of the
seventeenth century:&mdash;"Each chieftain had his armour-bearer, who
preceded his master in time of war, and, by my author's (Timothy Pont's
MS., Advocates' Library, Edinburgh) account in time of peace; for they
went armed even to church, in the manner the North Americans do at
present [1772] in the frontier settlement, and for the same reason, the
dread of savages." (Pinkerton's <i>Voyages</i>, vol. iii. p. 322.)</p></div>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>


<p>Most of the illustrations here given are reproductions of some of the
plates accompanying Captain Thomas's papers in the <i>Proceedings of the
Society of Antiquaries of Scotland</i>. In explanation of their details the
following extracts may be made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><a href="#image01"><span class="smcap">Plate I.</span> (Frontispiece).</a>&mdash;<i>Uamh Sgalabhad, South Uist.</i></h4>

<h4>(From Plate XXXV. of Vol. VII. of <i>Proceedings of the Society of
Antiquaries of Scotland</i>, First Series.)</h4>

<p>Captain Thomas thus describes his descent into and exploration of this
earth-house:&mdash;"An irregular hole was pointed out by the little lassie
before alluded to, and some of my party quickly disappeared below
ground. As they did not immediately return, I thought it was time to
follow, and squeezing through the ruinated entrance (<i>a</i>), I entered the
usual kind of gallery, which descended into the ground at a sharp angle.
At the bottom, on the right-hand side, was the usual guard-cell (<i>b</i>);
the sides of dry-stone masonry, but the end was the face of a rock <i>in
situ</i>. Proceeding on, the roof rose and the gallery widened to what was
the main chamber (<i>c</i>), which was 7 feet high under the apex of the
dome, and 4 feet broad. Upon the west side of this chamber, and about 2
feet from the ground, is a recess, about 2 feet square and 4 feet long.
At the further end, and in the same right line,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> the gallery (<i>d</i>)
became low (2&frac12; feet) and narrow (2 feet). Again the roof rose, and the
gallery widened till stopt, in face, by a large transported rock (<i>f</i>);
to the right of the rock a rectangular chamber (<i>e</i>), 2 feet broad,
extended 4 feet, and ended against rock <i>in situ</i>. Round, and beyond the
rock (<i>f</i>), the wall of the left side of the gallery was built, but the
passage was so narrow (<i>g</i>) that I contented myself by looking through
it. This incomprehensible narrowness is a feature in the buildings of
this period. Some of Captain Otter's officers pushed through into the
small chamber (<i>h</i>); beyond this the gallery was ruinated and
impassable; the total length explored was 45 feet."<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p><i>Fig. 8.</i> Captain Thomas selects this as "the most modern, and at the
same time the last, in all probability, that will be constructed in this
manner"&mdash;viz., "roofed by the horizontal or cyclopean arch, <i>i.e.</i>, by a
system of overlapping stones." "The woman who was living in it [about
1869] told us it was built for his shieling by Dr. Macaulay's
grandfather, who was tacksman [leaseholder] of Linshader ... and I
conclude that it was made about ninety years back."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p><i>Fig. 9.</i> Sir Arthur Mitchell says of this compound "bee-hive"
house:&mdash;"The greatest height of the living room&mdash;in its centre, that
is&mdash;was scarcely 6 feet. In no part of the dairy was it possible to
stand erect. The door of communication between the two rooms was so
small that we could get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> through it only by creeping. The great
thickness of the walls, 6 to 8 feet, gave this door, or passage of
communication, the look of a tunnel, and made the creeping through it
very real. The creeping was only a little less real in getting through
the equally tunnel-like, though somewhat wider and loftier passage,
which led from the open air into the first or dwelling room."<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

Campbell (<i>West Highland Tales</i>, vol. ii., pp. 39-40):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There was a woman in Baile Thangusdail, and she was out seeking a
couple of calves; and the night and lateness caught her, and there
came rain and tempest, and she was seeking shelter. She went to a
knoll with the couple of calves, and she was striking the
tether-peg into it. The knoll opened. She heard a gleegashing
(<i>gliogadaich</i>) as if a pot-hook were clashing beside a pot. She
took wonder, and she stopped striking the tether-peg. A woman put
out her head and all above her middle, and she said, 'What business
hast thou to be troubling this tulman [mound] in which I make my
dwelling?' 'I am taking care of this couple of calves, and I am but
weak. Where shall I go with them?' 'Thou shalt go with them to that
breast down yonder. Thou wilt see a tuft of grass. If thy couple of
calves eat that tuft of grass, thou wilt not be a day without a
milk cow as long as thou art alive, because thou hast taken my
counsel.'</p>

<p>"As she said, she never was without a milk cow after that, and she
was alive fourscore and fifteen years after the night that was
there."</p></div>

"that form of bo'h, Pict's house, or clochan, whichever name may be

about half a mile inland from Moll a Deas (South Beach); and the

or 'Weem.'] It consists of a partly excavated oval dwelling chamber
(<i>a</i>), 7 feet by 14 feet on the floor; the dome roof has fallen in;
there are two <i>cuiltean</i>, or niches in the wall. A low curved

one, must have been a light weight; in fact, we are almost driven to the
conclusion that there were no Bantings in those days. This guard-cell is
but 2 feet 5 inches high, and 3 feet in width. The gallery then turns at
a right angle to the left hand. We excavated it for 22 feet.... When
digging, we came upon two broken stone dishes (corn-crushers?) now in

<h4><span class="smcap">Plates <a href="#image14">XIV.</a>, <a href="#image15">XV.</a>, and <a href="#image16">XVI.</a></span>&mdash;<i>Maes-How, Orkney.</i></h4>

<p>These plates represent the "Pict's house" referred to by Captain Thomas
(pp. <a href="#Page_50">50-51</a>, <i>ante</i>), with regard to which he says:&mdash;"Maes howe was for
three families&mdash;grandees, no doubt; but the numbers it was intended to
hold in the <i>beds</i> may be learned by comparing them with the Amazon's
House, St. Kilda."</p>

<p>The structure last named is described by Captain Thomas and Mr. T.S.
Muir in vol. iii. of the <i>Proceedings</i> (pp. 225-228), where it is
stated:&mdash;"The Amazon's House is of the same class with our earliest
stone buildings&mdash;belonging to the era of cromlechs, stone-circles,
Picts' castles, &amp;c.; but while in other parts of Britain the style and
type have vanished for a thousand years, in the Outer Hebrides we find
them (in the Bothan [<i>i.e.</i>, 'boths' or 'bee-hive houses'] of Uig)
continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> to the present day." The following additional remarks by
Captain Thomas are also of interest in this connection:&mdash;"It appears
that besides the Tigh na Bhanna ghaisgach (Ty-na-Van-a-ghas-gec), or
Amazon's House&mdash;and of whom all tradition, except her name, has
gone&mdash;there are the remains of other submerged dwellings and hypogea.
Miss Euphemia MacCrimmon, the oldest inhabitant of that far-off island,
tells that a certain Donald Macdonald and John Macqueen, on passing a
hillock, heard churning going on within. And about thirty years ago,
when digging into the hillock to make the foundations of a new house,
they discovered what seemed to be the fairies' residence, built of
stones inside, and holes in the wall, or croops, as they call them, as
in Airidh na Bhannaghaisgach."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>It will be noticed that the "beds" in Maes-How are on a higher level
than the floor of the main chamber. "In the winter houses," observes
Captain Thomas,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> "the floor of the bed-place was raised 3 or 4 feet
above the ground."</p>

<p>The original use of Maes-How is a matter of opinion, and some have
assumed it to belong to the class of sepulchral mounds, although there
is no evidence in support of this belief. For many reasons, the opinions
of Captain Thomas are endorsed by the present writer. It may be added
that, prior to 1861, when the mound was opened, local tradition had
declared that it was the residence of a "hog-boy," or mound-dweller.</p>

the doorway of the Brugh, it may be mentioned that "the same kind of
ornament appears on a stone found amidst a heap which had once been a
'Pict's-house' in the island of Eday, Orkney;"<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and that in Orkney,
also, there has been found, in an underground house, a large stone
"saucer," or "tray," resembling the two shown in the ground plan of the
Brugh. (There appears to be no settled opinion as to the uses of those
"saucers.")</p>

<p>In connection with the identification of this mound with the "Brugh of
the Boyne" of ancient Irish history, the following remarks may be
quoted. The Rev. Father O'Laverty, in the Journal of the Royal Society
of Antiquaries of Ireland (December, 1892, p. 430) thus observes:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In his very valuable work, <i>The Boyne and Blackwater</i>, Sir William
Wilde appears to me to have used convincing arguments to prove that
<i>Brugh-na-Boinne</i> ... was ... on the left bank of the Boyne,
convenient to the ford of <i>Ros-na-righ</i> (Rossnaree) at Knowth,
Dowth, and Newgrange. To Sir William's arguments one point only was
wanting: the old name had disappeared.... It is now more than
thirty years since I went to Newgrange for the special purpose of
investigating that matter. I explained to Mr. Maguire, then of
Newgrange, and to his son, that <i>Brugh-na-Boinne</i> signified 'the
town, or dwelling-place, on the Boyne,' that the word <i>Brugh</i> would
assume the modern form <i>Bro</i>, as in Brughshane (pronounced
Broshane), and many other townland names, and that <i>na-Boinne</i>, 'of
the Boyne,' would probably cease to be used as unnecessary at the
site. I need not say that I was greatly pleased when they informed
me that the field in which is the mound of Newgrange is called the
<i>Bro-Park</i>, while in the immediate vicinity are the <i>Bro-Farm</i>, the
<i>Bro-Mill</i>, and the <i>Bro-Cottage</i>." [And also, they might have
added, the mansion of <i>Broe House</i>.]</p></div>

<p>Any one, therefore, who duly considers the matter, in relation to the
statements of both of these writers, will see that the mound at New
Grange is the <i>Brugh-na-Boinne</i> of Irish history and tradition. And this
name, says Father O'Laverty, "signified 'the town, or dwelling-place, on
the Boyne.'" What, then, are the earliest associations with this "town
or dwelling-place?"</p>

<p>It is said<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> to have been built by a celebrated "king and oracle" of
the people known as the Tuatha D&eacute;, Dea, or De Danann, and to have been
the residence of himself and others of his race. This chief (Eochaid
<i>Ollathair</i>) is usually referred to as "the Dagda," or "the Daghda M&ograve;r";
and of his nation it is asserted that, after having invaded Ireland and
conquered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> its native "Fir-Bolgs," they were themselves conquered in
turn by a later race of immigrants, the Gaels. This "Brugh," therefore,
is said to have been the residence of the Dagda, and, after him, of
Angus, one of his sons. Consequently, it is very frequently styled "the
Brugh of Angus, son of the Dagda," an appellation which assumes various
forms.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Latterly, it seems to have been most generally known as "the
Brugh" (<i>par excellence</i>), or, more simply still, as "Brugh." In the
Book of Leinster it is specified as one of "Ireland's three undeniable
eminences [<i>dindgna</i>]"<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>; while "an ancient poem by Mac Nia, son of
Oenna (in the Book of Ballymote, fol. 190 b.)," styles it "a king's
mansion" and a "<i>s&iacute;dh</i>." The same MS. (32 <i>a b</i>) gives the variant <i>S&iacute;dh
an Bhrogha</i>, rendered by Dr. Standish O'Grady "the fairy fort of the
<i>Brugh</i> upon the Boyne."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> This word "<i>s&iacute;dh</i>," which was
applied&mdash;probably in the first place&mdash;to hollow mounds such as this, but
which was also applied to the dwellers in them, gave the Tuatha De
Danann their most popular name. Because it was on account of their
residence in "the green mounds, known by the name of <i>S&iacute;dh</i>," that they
were called "the <i>Fir S&iacute;dhe</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, men of the <i>s&iacute;dhs</i>], or Fairies,
of Ireland."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The one word, indeed (<i>s&iacute;dh</i>), became indifferently
applied to the dwellings and the dwellers. Whichever was the earliest
meaning of that word, there is little dubiety as to the etymology of
<i>Siabhra</i>. In one copy of the <i>Leabhar na h-Uidhre</i>,<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> it is stated
that the Tuatha De Danann<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> "were called <i>Siabhras</i>." O'Reilly defines
<i>siabhra</i> as "a fairy," and <i>siabhrach</i> as "fairy-like"; while "a fairy
mansion" is <i>siabhrugh</i>. With Connellan, again, <i>siabhrog</i> is "a fairy."
It seems quite evident that these are all corruptions of <i>s&iacute;dh-bhrugh</i>
(otherwise <i>S&iacute;dh an Bhrogha</i>, as above), and that <i>Siabhra</i>, as applied
to the <i>dwellers</i>, was simply a transference from the name denoting
their <i>dwellings</i>.</p>

<p>Numerous as are the references to this mound as a "dwelling-place," its
name figures prominently in the list of the ancient cemeteries of
Ireland. <i>Relec in Broga</i>, "the Cemetery of the Brugh," is referred to
as one of "the three cemeteries of Idolaters," in an Irish manuscript of
the twelfth century (or earlier), the <i>Leabhar na h-Uidhre</i> cited above.
Of the two others, one is "the Cemetery of Cruachan"; and, by glancing
at it, in the first place, we shall obtain a good idea of the Cemetery
of the Brugh. "We find that the monuments within the cemetery at
Rathcroghan,"<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> says Mr. Petrie, "are small circular mounds, which,
when examined, are found to cover rude, sepulchral chambers formed of
stone, without cement of any kind, and containing unburned bones."<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
And the twelfth-century scribe whom Mr. Petrie largely quotes, says that
there were fifty such mounds (<i>cnoc</i>) in the cemetery at Cruachan. This
medi&aelig;val scholar has copied a poem on the subject, "ascribed to Dorban,
a poet of West Connaught," wherein it is said that it is not in the
power of poets or of sages to reckon the number of heroes under the
Cruachan mounds, and that there is not a hillock (<i>cnoc</i>) in that
cemetery "which is not the grave of a king or royal prince, or of a
woman, or warlike poet."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> In another verse, he says that <i>each</i> of the
fifty mounds had a warrior under it; and, altogether, it appears that,
although their number could doubtless be "reckoned," yet the burial
mounds of Cruachan, in or about the twelfth century, much exceeded fifty
in number. "Fifty" is simply used by the poet and his commentator to
show that, like the two other cemeteries of the triad (each of which is
also said to have had fifty) the Cemetery of Cruachan contained about a
third of the pagan notables of Ireland.</p>

<p>From this we see that, about the twelfth century, the Cemetery of the
Brugh contained at least fifty sepulchral mounds such as those described
by Mr. Petrie at Cruachan. Mr. Petrie further quotes two passages from
the <i>Dinnsenchus</i>, which specify in the following terms some of the most
famous of those "monuments" at the Brugh:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Grave [or Stone Cairn, <i>Leacht</i>] of the Dagda; the Grave of
Aedh Luirgnech, son of the Dagda; the Graves of Cirr and Cuirrell,
wives of the Dagda&mdash;'these are two hillocks [<i>da cnoc</i>]'; the Grave
of Esclam, the Dagda's Brehon, 'which is called <i>Fert-Patric</i> at
this day'; the Cashel [or Stone Enclosure] of Angus, son of
Crunmael; the Cave [<i>Derc</i>] of Buailcc Bec; the Stone Cairn
[<i>Leacht</i>] of Cellach, son of Maelcobha; the Stone Cairn [<i>Leacht</i>]
of the steed of Cinaedh, son of Irgalach; the Prison [<i>Carcar</i>] of
Liath-Macha; the 'Glen' of the Mata; the Pillar Stone of Buidi, the
son of Muiredh, where his head is interred; the Stone of Benn; the
Grave of Boinn, the wife of Nechtan; the 'Bed' of the daughter of
Forann; the <i>Barc</i> of Crimthann Nianar, in which he was interred;
the Grave of Fedelmidh, the Lawgiver; the <i>Cumot</i> of Cairbre
Lifeachair; the <i>Fulacht</i> of Fiachna Sraiphtine."</p></div>

<p>These, of course, are only some of the most famous of the sepulchral
monuments which existed in the Cemetery of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> Brugh eight or nine
centuries ago. Since that time, most of them have disappeared, their
stones having been presumably built into castles, mansions, cottages and
walls, while the bones of the queens and heroes have fertilised the soil
of the neighbouring farms. But there still remain a few
"standing-stones" and "moats" in the vicinity of the Brugh, all of which
may be included in the above list.</p>

<p>I have cited that list for the reason that modern antiquaries, or many
of them, have assumed that <i>S&iacute;d in Broga</i> and <i>Relec in Broga</i> are
synonymous terms, and that when a king or hero is recorded to have been
buried "at Brugh," that means that he was buried <i>in</i> the Brugh itself.
In other words, that a place which was known as Fert-Patrick in or about
the twelfth century, as also the "cashel" and the many hillocks, graves,
and cairns mentioned in the list&mdash;not to speak of innumerable
others&mdash;were all situated in the chamber which is shown in Plate XIX. It
does not require a moment's reflection to convince one that this is an
erroneous assumption. Nor is it warranted by the "History of the
Cemeteries" itself, which always speaks of the burials having been "<i>at</i>
Brugh."<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>One other statement, however, must be referred to. In another verse of
Dorban's poem, mentioned above, it is said that "the host of Meath" are
buried "<i>ar l&aacute;r in Broga tuathaig</i>." This is rendered by Petrie, "in the
middle of the lordly Brugh." The translation is no doubt good; and it is
open to any one to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> deduce therefrom that the chamber shown in the plan
contained at one time the skeletons of the host of Meath. In that case,
the "host" must have been very limited in number; and anyone who has
crawled along the sixty-foot passage into the Brugh, and who adopts this
view, must wonder a little as to how the corpses were conveyed along
that passage, and as to the reasons which must have induced some people
(prior to 1699, when the chamber was almost, if not altogether, void of
such relics)<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> to drag all those bones out again, at much personal
inconvenience. But "<i>ar l&aacute;r in Broga</i>" may also mean "in the [burying-]
ground of the Brugh"; and the descriptions quoted above from the
<i>Dinnsenchus</i> show quite clearly that the ground in which "the host of
Meath" were buried embraced a considerable tract of land, dotted over
with mounds and monuments, differing only in degree from those of a
modern cemetery.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>The twelfth-century commentator of Dorban's poem states:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The nobles of the Tuatha De Danann (with the exception of seven of
them who were interred at Talten [which was the third 'Cemetery of
the Idolaters']) were buried at Brugh, <i>i.e.</i>, Lugh, and Oe, son of
Ollamh, and Ogma, and Carpre, son of Etan, and Etan (the poetess)
herself, and the Dagda and his three sons (<i>i.e.</i>, Aedh, and
Oengus, and Cermait), and a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> many others besides of the
Tuatha De Dananns, and Firbolgs and others."<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p></div>

<p>But, afterwards, "the race of Heremon, <i>i.e.</i>, the kings of Tara," who
used to bury at Cruachan (because that was the chief seat in their
special principality of Connaught) came to bury at Brugh. "The first
king of them that was interred at Brugh" was a certain Crimthann,
surnamed <i>Nianar</i>, the son of Lughaidh Riabh-n-derg;<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and the reason
why Crimthann decided to abandon the burying-place of his forefathers
was "because his wife Nar was of the Tuatha Dea, and it was she
solicited him that he should adopt Brugh as a burial-place for himself
and his descendants, and this was the cause that they did not bury at
Cruachan."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> It would appear that the ruling dynasty of the Tuatha Dea
had ended in a female, both on account of Nar's action in this matter,
and because her husband became known by her name&mdash;as Nianar
(<i>Niadk-N&aacute;ir</i>) or "Nar's Champion."</p>

<p>This Nar is a very interesting personage in the present connection.
Because, being one of the Tuatha Dea, she was a <i>siabhra</i>, or woman of
the <i>s&iacute;dhs</i>; otherwise, a <i>bean-s&iacute;de</i> (modernised into "banshee"). This
is plainly stated in two other Irish manuscripts, with an additional
explanation which is very apposite. It is said that Crimthann was called
Nar's Champion "because his wife Nar <i>thuathchaech</i> out of the <i>s&iacute;dhes</i>,
or of the Pict-folk [<i>a s&iacute;daib no do Chruithentuaith</i>], she it was that
took him off on an adventure." A companion statement is that made in
another manuscript to the effect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> that "Nar <i>thuathchaech</i>, the
daughter of Lotan of the Pict-folk [<i>N&aacute;r thuathchaech ingen Lotain do
Chruithentuaith</i>], was the mother of Feradach <i>finnfhechtnach</i>," or "the
brightly prosperous"&mdash;a king of Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Incidentally, therefore, in considering the Brugh of the Boyne and the
people most associated with it, we find very distinct confirmation of
the main part of the contention in the foregoing treatise. From these
extracts it is evident that those early writers regarded <i>siabhra,
fear-s&iacute;dh, bean-s&iacute;dh</i>, and <i>daoine-s&iacute;dh</i> (words which may also be
interpreted "mound-dweller") as ordinary folk-names for the Picts; just
in the same way as any historian of the frontier wars in North America
would understand by "Red-skin" and "Greaser" the more classic "Indian"
and "Mexican."</p>

<h4><a href="#image20"><span class="smcap">Plates XX. and XXI.</span></a>&mdash;<i>The Denghoog, Island of Sylt, North
Friesland.</i></h4>

<p>In addition to my original collection, I am now able to show three views
of the Denghoog, in Sylt, which is the mound referred to on p. <a href="#Page_34">34</a>
(<i>ante</i>). Mr. W.G. Black speaks of it thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There is some confusion as to King Finn's dwelling. As doctors
differ, we may be allowed to claim that it was the Denghoog, close
to Wenningstedt, if only because we descended into that remarkable
dwelling. Externally merely a swelling green mound, like so many
others in Sylt, entrance is gained by a trap-door in the roof, and
decending a steep ladder, one finds himself in a subterranean
chamber, some seventeen by ten feet in size, the walls of which are
twelve huge blocks of Swedish granite;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> the height of the roof
varies from five feet to six feet. The original entrance appears to
have been a long narrow passage, seventeen feet long and about two
feet wide and high. This mound was examined by a Hamburg professor
in 1868, who found remains of a fireplace, bones of a small man,
some clay urns, and stone weapons. Later, a Kiel professor is said
to have carried off all he found therein to Kiel Museum, and so far
we have not been able to trace the published accounts of his
investigations."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p></div>

<p>Mr. Christian Jensen, Oevenum, F&ouml;hr, to whom I am indebted for these
three views, has favoured me with the following information:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The sketches of the Denhoog which I enclose [viz., the Ground Plan
and Sectional View] are from the drawings of Professor Wibel, who
conducted the excavation of it in 1868. From his and C.P. Hansen's
observations I contribute the following statements: Originally, the
mound was higher, but in 1868 it had the form of a truncated cone,
4&frac12; <i>m&egrave;tres</i> [say 14 feet 9 inches] in height. As may be seen from
the picture, it slopes away to the south above the original passage
into the mound, which the dweller made use of as his entrance; so
that the extent is very considerable. The present entrance, as may
be seen from the view of the interior, was made from above, at the
north side, directly opposite the original entrance.... Dr. Wibel
says: 'At the south side of the chamber is the doorway for ingress
and egress, with the passage itself leading from it. This passage,
which was 6 <i>m&egrave;tres</i> [19 feet 8 inches] in length, was lined with
upright blocks of granite and gneiss, with a roofing and floor made
of flagstones of the same kinds of stone. It was opened up all the
way to the mouth of the passage. This [the outer orifice] lay close
to the extremity of the earth and near the floor of the mound, was
closed with earth only, not with a stone, and measured about 1
<i>m&egrave;tre</i> [3 feet 3.4 inches] in height, and 1&#8531; <i>m&egrave;tre</i> in breadth.
On account of these dimensions ... one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> can only creep through
with difficulty, and for that reason the plan does not show with
accuracy the position of the wall-slabs, and their number is merely
conjectured to be nine.'</p>

<p>"Immediately after this excavation of 17-19 September, 1868, C.P.
Hansen writes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'There are in the island of Sylt hillocks of ancient origin, for
the most part pagan burying-places, but some of which may have
served as the dwelling-places of a primitive people. One such
hillock has just been opened at Wenningstedt. The interior was
found to be a chamber, 17 feet long, 10 feet in breadth, and from 5
to 6 feet in height, with a covered passage about 22 feet long,
trending southward. The walls of this underground room were
composed of twelve large granite blocks, regularly arranged; the
roof consisted of three still larger slabs of the same kind of
rock; the stones which formed the passage were smaller. At one
corner of the floor of the cellar there was a well-defined
fireplace, and near it were urns and flint implements; in the
opposite corner there were many bones lying, apparently unburned,
probably those of the last dweller in the cavern.'"</p></div>

<p>Mr. Christian Jensen gives an account of "Der Denghoog bei Wenningstedt"
in the "Beilage zu Nr. 146 der Flensburger Nachrichten" of 25th June
1893, in which he says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"... On the floor of the chamber, three separate divisions were
distinctly visible, of which one, situated on the east side, showed
traces of having been a fireplace. Professor Wibel found several
fragments of human bones, which evidently belonged only to <i>one</i>
individual, as no portion was duplicated; also a few animals'
bones. There was an extraordinary number of fragments of pottery,
belonging to about 24 different urns, of which 11 could be put
together. Their form and ornamentation were both fine and varied,
an interesting witness to the ceramics of the grey past.... Among
the stone implements found were a great many flint-knives; two
stone hatchets, two chisels, and a gouge, all of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> flint, and a disc
of porphyry were also obtained. Several mineral substances,
quartzite, rubble-stones, gravel, ochre, a sinter-heap&mdash;these are
less interesting than the seven amber beads which, with some
charcoal, completes the list of objects found. Referring to former
investigations of galleried mounds [<i>gangbauten</i>], which seem to
have been used in some cases as burying-places, in others as
dwellings, Dr. Wibel observes, in answer to the question resulting
from his discovery, as to whether the Denghoog ought to be regarded
as a sepulchre or as a dwelling, that, as Nilsson has already said,
all gallery-mounds were originally dwellings, and occasionally
became utilised as tombs. In the case of the Denghoog, this fact is
demonstrated by the fireplace, the scattered potsherds, the amber
beads, &amp;c."</p></div>

<p>Of the little woodcut which forms the <a href="#image22">Tailpiece</a> of this volume, it is
hardly necessary to say that it represents some popular ideas regarding
"the little people." The woodcut of which this is a facsimile is one of
those contained in the eighteenth-century chap-book, "<i>Round about our
Coal Fire</i>; or, Christmas Entertainments," and it heads the chapter "<i>Of
Fairies, their Use and Dignity</i>." "They generally came out of a
Mole-hill," it is said; "they had fine Musick always among themselves,
and Danced in a Moonshiny Night around, or in a Ring as one may see at
this Day upon every Common in <i>England</i>, where Mushroones [<i>sic</i>] grow,"
The size of the mushroom, so elegantly depicted in the foreground, is
quite on a scale suitable to the stature ultimately accorded to the
little people in many districts; so also is the mole-hill. But the tree,
and the Satanic head in the foliage, are curiously out of proportion.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>An examination of these various diagrams will show that the more
primitive of those structures were obviously built by a small-sized
race; some of the passages being quite impassable to large men of the
present day. This peculiarity was noticed by Scott when visiting the
"brochs" of Shetland, a kindred class of structures (none of which are
here shown). "These Duns or Picts' Castles are so small," he says,
writing in his Diary in August 1814, "it is impossible to conceive what
effectual purpose they could serve excepting a temporary refuge for the
chief." This reflection was suggested to him by the Broch of
Cleik-him-in (now usually written Clickemin), near Lerwick; and in
describing it he says: "The interior gallery, with its apertures, is so
extremely low and narrow, being only about three feet square, that it is
difficult to conceive how it could serve the purpose of communication.
At any rate, the size fully justifies the tradition prevalent here, as
well as in the south of Scotland, that the Picts were a diminutive
race." Of the Broch of Mousa he says: "The uppermost gallery is so
narrow and low that it was with great difficulty I crept through it,"&mdash;a
feat which baffled the present writer.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> In all those cases, of
course, it is understood one has to crawl. As with the Lapps and the
Eskimos, creeping was much more a matter of course with the builders of
those places than it is with us. After getting through such passages it
happens that, in several instances, the roof is higher than is required
for the tallest living man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> An admirable example of such a place is the
underground "Picts' House" at Pitcur, in Forfarshire, which would be
quite a palace to people of a small race, and very likely figures as
such in some popular tale; its dimensions and appearance considerably
magnified with every century.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> But even this "fairy palace" was
entered by narrow, downward-sloping passages, similar to that seen in
the Frontispiece, down and up which the dwellers had to crawl. An
underground gallery such as that of Ardtole (near Ardglass, County
Down), is somewhat puzzling, because, while one chamber off it rises to
a height of 5 feet 3 inches, another is only 3&frac12; feet high; and the main
gallery, for 70 feet of its length, is 4&frac12; feet high, with a width of 3
feet 4 inches. The inference from this seems to be that the occupants
were under 4&frac12; feet in height. If they had intended to crawl along the 70
feet, they did not require so high a roof; whereas, if they walked, and
if they were more than 4&frac12; feet in height, they would need to walk the 70
feet in a stooping posture, a constraint which they could easily have
avoided by raising the roof a foot or two. The highest roof in all this
souterrain being 5 feet 3, it does not seem likely that the builders
were taller than that; and there seems more reason to believe that they
were much smaller. Another such gallery in Sutherlandshire is "nowhere
more than 4&frac12; feet in height, and for the greater part of its length only
2 feet wide, expanding to 3&frac12;, for about 3 feet only from the inner end."
Still more restricted is the "rath-cave" of Ballyknock, in the parish of
Ballynoe, barony of Kinnatalloon, County Cork. "The cave is a mere
cutting in the clayey subsoil, and is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> roofed with flags resting on the
clayey banks of the cutting, of which the length is about 100 feet, and
the height and width from 3 to 3&frac12; feet, except that the width to a
height of 2 feet is hardly a foot at the N.W. turn, 23 feet from the
N.E. end, and at a point 27 feet from the S.E. end.... Right below the
aperture ... was a short pillar-stone, deeply scored with Oghams ...
[and] many of the roofing slabs were seen ... to be inscribed with
Oghams, some large and others minute."<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>"This class of structures deserves a careful study," observes Captain
Thomas, referring to the souterrains of the north-west of Scotland;<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
"for the room or accommodation afforded by this mode of building is
exceedingly small when compared with the labour expended in procuring
it; besides, the doorway or entry is often so contracted that no bulky
object, not even a very stout man, could get in ... But what are we to
think when the single passage is so small that only a child could crawl
through it?"</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_94_94" id="Footnote_94_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_94_94"><span class="label">[94]</span></a> On the very topmost course of all, the gallery dwindles
into such insignificant dimensions that not even a dwarf (as one would
naturally understand that term) could creep along it. Scott cannot have
meant this very extremity. With regard to it, I should be inclined to
say that it was merely the necessary finish of the gallery, not intended
to be used any more than the spaces beside the eaves of a house.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_95_95" id="Footnote_95_95"></a><a href="#FNanchor_95_95"><span class="label">[95]</span></a> The tendency to "idealisation on the part of the narrator"
is referred to, in this connection, by Mr. Joseph Jacobs, at p. 242 of
his "English Fairy Tales" (London, D. Nutt, 1890).</p></div>

reads: "Branan, son of Ochal," and that the decipherer (the Rev. Edmond
Barry, M.R.I.A.) identifies this latter name with "the name of a King of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
